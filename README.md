Open the file "head.py" and in line 47, enter the second graph. And in line 48 the first graph, then save your file.

This program uses the file list of edges to present the graph (e a b).

Run the "1_install.py" file that will create a sqlite (isom) to store the graph1 and graph2 files, and automatically activate the other python files.

The file "10_fin.py" gives a file "solutions.txt", this file will stop the pc (it is disabled, but for large graphs it is advisable to activate it).
